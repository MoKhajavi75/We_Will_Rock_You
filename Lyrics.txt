Queen – We Will Rock You Lyrics


Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise, 
Playin' in the street, gonna be a big man some day
You got mud on yo' face, you big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place, singin'

We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man, 
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world some day
You got blood on yo' face, you big disgrace
Wavin' your banner all over the place

We will we will rock you (sing it)
We will we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man, 
Pleadin' with your eyes, gonna make you some peace some day
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

We will we will rock you (sing it)
We will we will rock you (everybody)
We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you
Alright
